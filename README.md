First Update
This first update has the backend and frontend of the register and login

![The main page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0596ac43-99da-406e-99b3-090ddc102434)

![Register page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b05b9fd-ccb0-453a-919c-77f9e1a55b0a)

![Login page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3016cd7b-52ec-4628-a95c-19c571677469)

The information of the users are stored in a db in postgres.

When the user logins they go to the chat page that at the moment looks like this ![chat-page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fdfb8ee-9e01-4070-956c-e6cda46b0e95) but it doesn't do anything yet.
