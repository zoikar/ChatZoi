Bootcamp 25.03 - final project - Karagianni Zoi

This is the read me file for the project I created called ChatZoi. ChatZoi is another version of a basic ai chat, where the user registers and can chat with an ai, create new threads, delete old ones and change their basic information if they please. Below is a basic layout of the project.

Firstly, when the user runs the project they see this page

![main page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b052eab-69b8-4ccb-8ab5-8e0a96d88d58)

They can choose to either register or login. If they choose to register they navigate to the following page.

![register page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b692bdd3-82c7-4dd4-806d-a81c91692a22)

and if they choose to login they navigate to this page.

![login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a333392f-2f7a-408f-b70f-db3ecb7b47df)

When it is the first time that the user logins in the application they see the following image. On the left there is the conversations side where the user can click on the + button to add a new thread. On the top there is a bar with the name of the application and to the left there is a button that navigates to the users profile. When the user creates a thread and clicks on it, the name of that thread will be displayed in the middle of the top bar. To the bottom there is the text area with the send button and to the middle is where the conversations will appear.

If the user clicks on the top right icon they navigate to the profile section where they can edit their information (name, email, password) or they can logout.

This is a very simple version of the app. In the future more modifications will happen.
